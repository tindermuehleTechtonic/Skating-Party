      <h2>What is Xanadu?</h2>

    </aside>

    <p>If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

        This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You're meant to have fun in life. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.
        
        You can do anything your heart can imagine. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You can get away with a lot. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
        
        Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. It all happens automatically. You need the dark in order to show the light.
        
        It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. The least little bit can do so much.
        
        By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. That easy.
        
        I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>
