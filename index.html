    <p>It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things
      in the world. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just make a
      decision and let it go. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Have fun with it.

      Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Every time you practice, you learn
      more. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.

      Now then, let's play. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Get away from those little
      Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Use what you see, don't plan it. Water's like me. It's laaazy ...
      Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things

      Let's have a little bit of fun today. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay
      though; I have more fun than most people. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. A fan brush can be your best
      friend.

      Work that paint. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that
      happens. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. All you need to paint is a
      few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

      Everybody needs a friend. Don't be bashful drop me a line. You can do anything your heart can imagine. We don't
      really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

      If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Everything's
      not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.

      You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We'll throw some happy little
      limbs on this tree. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. The very fact that you're
      aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. And that's when it
      becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

      We'll do another happy little painting. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Son of a gun.

      Let's do it again then, what the heck. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Just think about these
      things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.

      It takes dark in order to show light. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
      Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Let's
      go up in here, and start having some fun If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

      Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let your heart be your guide.
      I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by
      our imagination. We have a fantastic little sky!

      Let's build some happy little clouds up here. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things.
      Just let them happen. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.

      Let your imagination be your guide. See there how easy that is. It's so important to do something every day that
      will make you happy. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a
      happy dream in your heart. What the devil. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.

      Anything you want to do you can do here. In life you need colors. You need the dark in order to show the light.
      Here's something that's fun. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the
      garbage. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.

      God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You could sit
      here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty
      brush. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the
      windows to your soul.

      They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the
      critics. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Poor old tree. There is
      immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. You can do anything here. So don't
      worry about it.

      Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
      Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. A beautiful little sunset.

      Just a little indication. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. You create the dream -
      then you bring it into your world.

      Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Just let these leaves jump off the brush It looks so
      good, I might as well not stop. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Maybe there was an old
      trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river
      and drowned.
